Strategy:
    4 hours candlesticks
MACD

uptrend

Check supports ?
VWAP bigger support 2-3 hours VWAP under our prices then it's a support -> When it touches VWAP


-Implement VWAP
-Implement *if* uptrend
-Implement MACD

Might use 200 EMA to test direction of market, if market above -> Uptrend

Market above EMA and MACD line crosses above signal while greatly below 0-> Buy
Market below EMA and MACD line crosses below signal while above 0 -> Sell

if last open below vwap and close above buy signal (Maybe check if next candle stick is green)
If last open above vwap and close below sell signal
